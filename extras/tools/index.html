                <li>what you are essentially doing is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test driven development (TDD)</a> (yes, there are programs that test programs)</li>
                <li>you are writing programs that fulfills certain requirements (or tests)</li>
                <li>typically with TDD, you will be writing the tests and the programs, whereas, in our case, the graders have written the tests for your programs to be built against</li>
                <li>TDD is an industry best practice</li>
                <li>there are other flavors/extensions of TDD such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">behavior driven development (BDD)</a></li>

            <li>the homework self checking tool will print out a report (e.g. <em class="file">zhaol_02_1.report</em> to show you your rough score as well as which criterion was not satisfied</li>
            <li>you can modify your assignment and rerun the self checking program as many times as you want or need</li>
            <li>ensure you are running the above command in the directory with your assignment files

            <li>the homework upload tool will package your assignment files and then upload them to your Laulima Dropbox</li>
            <li>then you are able to attach the files from Laulima Dropbox to your Laulima Assignments, without needing to upload the files manually</li>
            <li>Laulima Assignments will allow you to resubmit/reattach files up until the deadline, in case you made some changes to the assignment</li>
            <li>if the homework upload tool does not package and upload all of the required assignment files, then please post this issue to Piazza</li>
            <li>please note that it is the student's responsibility to ensure that all of the required files are properly named and attached to Laulima Assignments (files in Laulima Dropbox and your Cloud9 workspace are not graded)</li>

            <p>without <code>wget</code> one would need to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>create a new file</li>
              <li>copy &amp; paste the code from <a href="https://github.com/zhaol/ee160/blob/gh-pages/code/hello_world/hello_world.c">hello_world.c</a> to the new file</li>
